README for Ruby Fiction Generator

This is based on David Malki's 'The Electro-Plasmic Hydrocephalic Genre-Fiction Generator 2000' work. The prototype diagram is at http://wondermark.com/554/ and you can follow a link there to a version written in Javascript and python if you like. 

The files here are used part of the assessment work for in Web Application Development and can be run using the includedd Rakefile. The rspec_config.rb file provides colour settings.

The rakefile will work through the fiction_spec.rb file tests and then those in the later_fiction_spec.rb files.

Your job is to write a program to pass all of the tests. 

If you want to run the files without the rakefile, then you'll need to set the path to the file with this require statement at the top of the spec file:

require "#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/fiction_gen"

If you don't have this, then rspec won't find your file. 

I should also point out that the colour settings will be missing if you do this.

You will need to use these strings for different arrays in the program. Each line is a word or 
phrase that is needed to develop the fiction generator as detailed at the link noted above.
